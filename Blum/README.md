# Blum Airdrop Bot

## Description

Blum Airdrop Bot automates interactions with the Blum airdrop platform. It includes functionalities to claim rewards, manage farming sessions, complete tasks, and play games automatically.

## Features

- **Claim Farm Reward**: Automatically claim rewards from farming activities.
- **Start Farming Session**: Begin a new farming session.
- **Auto Complete Tasks**: Automatically complete available tasks and claim rewards.
- **Auto Play and Claim Game Points**: Play games and claim game points automatically.
- **Claim Daily Reward**: Automatically claim daily rewards.

## Flows

### Default Flow

The **Default Flow** allows users to manually select specific tasks to perform. You can choose from:

1. **Claim Farm Reward**: Automatically claim farm rewards.
2. **Start Farming Session**: Begin a new farming session.
3. **Auto Complete Tasks**: Complete and claim rewards for available tasks.
4. **Auto Play and Claim Game Points**: Play games and claim game points.
5. **Claim Daily Reward**: Claim your daily reward.

After performing an action, you can choose to set up a cron job for regular automation or exit the bot if no automation is needed.

### One-time Flow

The **One-time Flow** runs a continuous sequence of tasks without manual intervention. This flow includes:

1. **Claim Farm Reward**: Claim the farm reward.
2. **Claim Daily Reward**: Claim the daily reward.
3. **Claim Game Points**: Play games and claim game points.
4. **Start Farming Session**: Begin a new farming session.

The One-time Flow will continuously execute these tasks, handling errors gracefully and attempting to restart after a specified delay (e.g., 12 hours) if issues arise.
